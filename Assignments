You and your rich Uncle Jimmy just purchased Maven Movies, a brick and mortar DVD Rental business. Uncle Jimmy put up the money, and you’re in charge of the day-to-day operations. As a new owner, you’ll need to learn everything you can about your business: your product inventory, your staff, your customer purchase behaviors, etc. You have access to the entire Maven Movies SQL database, but the remaining employees are not able to give you much direction. You’ll need to analyze everything on your own.
